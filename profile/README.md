## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️ Vultisig is a multichain multisig vault that does not need any specialised hardware. It supports most UTXO, EVM, BFT and EdDSA Chains.
It is based on [go-tss](https://github.com/bnb-chain/tss-lib/tree/master).

Vultisig is built by the founders of THORChain - who built the largest and oldest working multi-chain DEX with Threshold-signatures. 

Create a vault:
* 2 of 2 (fastest setup, not backed up)
* 2 of 3 (recommended, backed up)
* 3 of 4 (most secure)

🔮 Vultisig Vaults are better than Single-Sig or Multi-sig Wallets:

1) Vultisig vault shares do not store funds - thus no funds at risk if you lose a key. 
2) There is no on-chain registration of signing-keys.
3) Vultisig is compatible on all chains (other Multi-sigs are not)
4) Vultisig is fully DeFi compatible (other Multi-sigs are not)

📱 Vultisig uses your favourite Laptops, Tablets and Phones. 
1) Rich, large screens with familiar UI
2) Secure Enclaves to store vault shares, with biometric locking. 
3) Does not look a hardware device (not a honeypot)

🌈 Vultisig is open-source, based on secure technology and is [audited]([https://code4rena.com/reports/2024-06-vultisig](https://docs.vultisig.com/threshold-signature-scheme/security)). There is no registration required.
